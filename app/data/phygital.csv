✍🏻 Writing marketing copies for their storefronts (websites, product titles, descriptions, FAQs).
💌 Crafting Email/SMS/WhatsApp marketing copies (subject lines, body content).
📽️ Creating engaging social media posts, ad copies, and video scripts.
🛒 Developing brand-building materials (about us, brand positioning, brand guidelines).

Though some have made progress in these areas, there is still a need for actionable and tailored solutions that are specific to the industry, brand tone & positioning, different events, and offers.

"a method for transferring the style from a set of images to a 3D object. The texture appearance of an asset is optimized with a differentiable renderer in a pipeline based on losses using pretrained deep neural networks. More specifically, we utilize a nearest-neighbor feature matching loss with CLIP-ResNet50 to extract the style from images. We show that a CLIP-based style loss provides a different appearance over a VGG-based loss by focusing more on texture over geometric shapes. Additionally, we extend the loss to support multiple images and enable loss-based control over the color palette combined with automatic color palette extraction from style images.
